Machine leanring is the next wave of computing not only does it aid 
in computation, predcition, classification, etc. Machine learning also provides
a model model for learning. 

Example of Machine Learning:
Prediction - an online movie rental company wants to know how a viewr will 
rate a movie.

You need 3 components of to form a machine learning problem:
1. A pattern must exist.
2. The patterm must not be explained mathematically (otherwise whats the point)
3. You have to have data related tot he problem

Learning Approach:
Machine Learning reverse engineers the learning process. Starts with a rating / 
answer, and tries to figure out what factors (provided by given data) would be consistent with that rating. 

Components of Learning:
Input X = represented as a d-dimensional vector, list of training examples 
Output Y = Results / Outputs from those examples
Targe Function = f: x->y - this is unknown, this is what your algorithm is trying to find

Data (x,y)......(xn,yn)

Hypothesis: formula to approximate the target function g:x->y

Hypothesis set represented by H = {h} 
					{h} = set of hypotheses
For input x = (x1....xn) “attributes”
let T = sum from i=1 to d of wi*xi – threshold

We can introducew an artificial coordinate of x0 = 1

h(x) = +- sum from 0 to d of wi * xi

in vector form +- sign w(transpose) *x


Learning algorithm navigates hypothesis to get to final hypothesis

A simple learning algorithm – perceptior learning algorithm

implements h(x) given your training set

Pick a misclassified point apply iteration you will get a correct solution

Types of learning

Basic premise of learning
“using a set of observations to uncover an underlying process” 
another form of this = probability distribution

In machine learning you have different types of learning models:

Supervised learning: Included in your dataset are known points. ergo for each input
x you have an output y. This combination is used for future prediction.

Unsupervised learning: You have a list of data but it is up to you to decipher 
the meaning. ergo for each x you must create a y

Reinforcement learning: A mixture of the two, you have a set of input data, with
incomplete set of output data.
